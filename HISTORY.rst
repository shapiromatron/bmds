.. _`bmds-server`: https://bmds-server.readthedocs.io/


v0.9.0 (2017-11-07)
-------------------
* Add BMDS version 2.7
* Added new ``Reporter`` class for creating Microsoft Word reports, as well as a default template for creating Word files. The reports may contain:
    - a table for the input dataset (on by default)
    - a summary table of model summary results (on by default)
    - a summary table of model recommendation notes (on by default)
    - the recommended model output file and figure (on by default)
    - all executed model output files and figures (off by default)
* Increased BMDS_MODEL_TIMEOUT_SECONDS from 10 to 30 seconds
* Revised outputs figures generated by library
    - modify BMDL line to be consistent with BMDS library (align with BMR)
    - add new options to specify xlabel and ylabel
    - revise title to include dataset name and BMR
    - add legend


v0.8.1 (2017-06-06)
-------------------
* Use ``asyncio.create_subprocess_exec`` instead of custom Thread implementation for running BMDS models
* Add new output to capture if BMDS model killed (``execution_halted``) based on Timeout; added to all output formats
* Capture ``stdout`` and ``stderr`` for models which successfully complete  (in variables appropriately named ``stdout`` and ``stderr``); added to dict and data-frame outputs
* Added new setting, ``MAXIMUM_POLYNOMIAL_ORDER``, by default equal to 8
* Added new setting, ``SUFFICIENTLY_CLOSE_BMDL``, by default equal to 3
* Delimit text messages (logic-failures, warnings) by newline instead of semicolon
* Add BMDS version and python BMDS version to session dictionary outputs
* Set exponential model direction based on dataset instead of letting model guess- this should fix failures where exponential models write "Error in closing opened file" to stdout
* Improved documentation on model recommendation logic
* Revise ``ContinuousDataset.is_increasing`` for better edge-case checks
* Capture observed fit dose and response for exponential continuous individual models; which allows calculation for a residual of interest
* Added Appveyor_ for testing on Windows

v0.8.0 (2017-04-28)
-------------------
* **BREAKING CHANGE üí•üí•üí•**: dropped support for Python 2 and Python ‚â§ 3.4
* **PERFORMANCE üèÅüèÅüèÅ**: asyncio_ python 3 standard library used for performance gains
* Added new :ref:`performance section <performance>` notes on eeking out more speed using multiprocessing_
* Fix memory leak by closing matplotlib figures
* Added new optional ``dpi`` argument to ``Session.save_plots()``
* Allow ``**kwargs`` arguments in datasets; these are returned in ``to_dict()``

.. _multiprocessing: https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html#processpoolexecutor

v0.7.0 (2017-03-17)
-------------------
* Recommend the most parsimonious model, instead of the first model with target AIC/BMDL
* Add new method to the session, ``execute_and_recommend``, with the option to try dropping doses until a model recommendation exists, or the dataset is exhausted
* Add runtime details to output
* Hide model failure popup when bmds unexpectedly fails  (significant performance boost)
* Log failures by default, including displaying failed input (d) files

v0.6.0 (2017-03-10)
-------------------
* Added new ``drop_dose`` method to Dataset
* Do not attempt to execute model when there are too few dose-groups
* Remove doses-dropped parameter from dataset init
* Add example notebook running actual data

v0.5.3 (2017-03-02)
-------------------

* Prevent errors when software is run with un-runnable dose-response datasets
* Handle edge-cases for ANOVA calculation failure
* Fix 002 bmds temporary file cleanup

v0.5.2 (2017-02-15)
-------------------

* Add custom exceptions for BMDS package
* Explicitly check that BMDS remote-server authentication is successful
* Hotfix - fix error when running continuous models with 3 dose groups

v0.5.1 (2016-12-23)
-------------------

* hotfix - fix exponential models (they create additional temporary files, had to ensure that they're collected and removed.)

v0.5.0 (2016-12-23)
-------------------

* For multistage and multistage cancer, by default an order 1 polynomial model is also executed (previously started at order 2)
* Update documentation beyond quickstart including API
* Export results as a pandas DataFrame, CSV, or Excel, in addition to JSON, and python dictionaries
* Generate dose-response plots using matplotlib
* Export dose-response plots
* Improve documentation with better describing API and quickstart

v0.4.0 (2016-12-14)
-------------------

* Added Dichotomous-Hill model to list of dichotomous models
* Allowed global overrides (such as BMR settings) as an optional input to ``Session.add_default_models``
* Updated test-logic outputs for individual tests (and added tests)
* For continuous summary datasets, rename ``responses`` array to ``means``
* By default, polynomial-like models are run multiple times with different degrees.
    - Previously, a single polynomial model was added with an order of ``min(n-1, 8)``, where ``n`` is the number of dose-groups. Now, multilpe models are added ranging from ``[3 - min(n-1, 8)]``, inclusive
    - Polynomial like models include: Polynomial, Multistage, and Multistage-Cancer
* Added the ability to use individual continuous data, instead of summary data

v0.3.0 (2016-12-05)
-------------------

* Model recommendation system enabled [`Wignall et al. 2014`_]
* Default continuous variance model now calculated based on dataset using same statistics as BMDS [Thanks Longlong!]
* Default polynomial restriction based on if dataset is increasing or decreasing (previously unrestricted)
* Add new batch dFileRunner to execute multiple dfiles in batch-mode (integration w/ bmds-server)
* Updated Makefile to include with a new tmux developer environment
